# 🚗 Road Obstacle Detection for Night Driving

## 📖 Overview
This project is designed to help drivers detect obstacles on the road during night driving using computer vision.  
It uses a camera (or video input) and Python’s OpenCV library to identify obstacles (like vehicles, pedestrians, or other objects) in low-light conditions.


## 🧠 Objectives
- Detect obstacles in real time using image processing.
- Enhance night vision capability using brightness and contrast correction.
- Provide an alert system when an obstacle is detected within a certain distance.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.12+
- **Libraries:**  
  - OpenCV (`cv2`) – for image processing and object detection  
  - NumPy – for array and image data manipulation  
  - (Optional) TensorFlow / YOLO model – for better object detection  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
